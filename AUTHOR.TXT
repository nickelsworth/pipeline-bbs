Just some notes for anyone who might see this source.  Not all of this
software is written by me, part of it is still Crimson Blade's code that I
never got around to changing.  Approximately half the bbs has been rewrote
from the original code in ViSiON/2 .84 where I started.  The easy way to tell
the difference is the formatting of the code, I was very picky where Crimson
was not.
